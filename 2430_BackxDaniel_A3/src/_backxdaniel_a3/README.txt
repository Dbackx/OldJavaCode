This is a program Modified from Fsong's original Assignment 2 by Daniel Backx. 

This program built for Assignment 3 completes the following tasks:

Allows for a search by title. This search will insist on searching through existing items in the program's memory, 
however if nothing is found will instead revert to searching www.Chapters.ca through their data base, 
displaying search results and adding found results to it's own data base for future reference.

This program has also been modified from Fsong's original Assignment 2 to also contain a Hashmap containing all entry's 
parsed words. This allows for a much faster, and more efficeint search by title function.

Please note: The search function has been tested to find Music and Books, and will convert found 'DVD's' to type Movie. 
For Reliable and tested results to compare to failure's (if they should occur) test the following search options:

Star Wars
Robin Hobb 
Rise Against
J.R.R Tolkien
Bon Jovi
